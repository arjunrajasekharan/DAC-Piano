# DAC-Piano
DAC Using R-2R Ladder Circuit To Implement Piano

# Logic
● Constructed R-2R Ladder Design for 8-bits in Tivac Board using resistors, wire connectors, and connected Multimeter and in the R-2R Ladder.

● The 8-bit binary value is assigned to 8 ports of Port B

● GPIO Ports (E and F) are initialized as digital pins and set to input
mode.

● Unlock PORT E and F and disable the analog function. We also clear
the PCTL register for Ports E and F.

● Configured the Tiva C board pin connections for resistors in the R-2R
ladder (port B pins).

● Each button corresponds with a different keynote and has a
frequency index for each button.

● By reading the corresponding PORTS (Port E and F) , the button
pressed is found.

● Pushbutton signals are sent to Tiva C pin connections ( VCC, GND,
taking output signal from push buttons when pressed and feeding the
input to Tiva C - 4 port E and 4 port F GPIO pins).

● Binary input values (corresponding frequencies of piano notes) are
sent from Tiva C to corresponding R-2R Ladder resistors in the circuit.

● GPIO PE0-PE3 and PF0-PF3 ports are set from Tiva C to R-2R ladder DAC to Piezo to play the specific frequency.

● GPIO Port B in range of PB0-PB7 Pin is read from R-2R Ladder to corresponding Tiva C Button Connected GPIO Port ranging from PE0-PE3 and PF0-PF3 Port.

● Sine Waves are generated by setting frequency for 8 Basic notes in music to get through DAC R-2R Ladder.
